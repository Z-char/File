something unfair about the competition: 

overview, process, procedure

1. April 26th, 2021. One person whose alias is Karry5307, a participant in the Provincial Team Selection of Hunan was doubted that he plagiarismed other's solution. He just hided and did not give some responses about our scepticism. And he was punished after a long time. I appreciate that CCF maintains impartial. But we could prevent the suspected cheating happend.
2. About the 2022 FJOI, a coach who did not use the website called codeforces to submit code for almost five years submited two programs which is the same as the code from the top programmer of the last three years whose alias is tourist. And in FJOI, these two problems appeared and all the students trained with the coach got full marks on the two problems which was not easy! What are the odds of that? And in the second test, there was a title which hasn't been solved until now. That solution was an obviously wrong code which earned full marks. I know this because its data promised a strong restriction but the restriction was not mentioned in the statement of the problem. We spent so much time on this problem and we couldn't come with the solution or earn any marks. This would surely affect anyone's emotions and mindset. This competition was almost at the national level. Safeguarding its integrity is important. Should such a big mistake have ever happened at such a significant competition?
3. And there's some weak data for some problems. Like that you estimate that you can enter the province team, but because some problems has so weak data so some wrong algorithm can get higher scores than they should get. And you can't enter the province team or something else.
4. And I know that Tingqiang Xu is a pretty great coder. He used a optimise option called O3 in China Team Selection. The rule did not ban that. But the organization deducted his marks.

Are the things above fair?
